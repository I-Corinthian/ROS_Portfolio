# ROS2 Robotics Portfolio

Welcome to my ROS 2 Robotics Portfolio! This repository showcases a series of projects I have developed to demonstrate my skills and expertise in robotics using the Robot Operating System (ROS 2). Each project is designed to highlight different aspects of robotics, including simulation, control, navigation, and computer vision.

## Projects

### 1. ROS2 Differential Drive Robot Simulation
**Description**: A simple URDF model of a differential drive robot, simulated in Gazebo and controlled via keyboard teleoperation.

### 2. TurtleBot3 Simulation and Navigation
**Description**: Demonstrates navigation and obstacle avoidance for TurtleBot3 in a simulated environment using the ROS 2 navigation stack and Gazebo.

Each project includes detailed documentation, setup instructions, and usage examples to help you understand and replicate the work. Feel free to explore the repositories and try out the projects on your own setup!

Thank you for visiting my portfolio. If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out.
